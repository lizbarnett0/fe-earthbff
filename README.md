# EarthBFF

We only have one Earth, so letâ€™s treat it like our best friend!

EarthBFF is a carbon footprint calculator that educates the user on their carbon footprint and allows them to correct behavior in order to live a more environmentally friendly life. It also is a place where people can learn about climate change from our extensive resources and meet like-minded people by posting on our community bulletin board.
